Today I dropped into the [GitHub Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/) event — super chill vibe, lots of curious minds, and great convos. Here's what stood out from my short but insightful session:

## 🚀 MVC Server Setup with VS Code

One contributor demoed how they structure and run **MVC-based servers locally** with VS Code. A few notes:

- Clean folder structuring: `models/`, `controllers/`, `views/`
- Quick Dev server with `live-server` or `nodemon`
- Debugging + launch config in `.vscode/launch.json` – very handy

I’m planning to replicate this structure for a simple LLM-backed agent UI next week.

## 📘 AstroDocs – Beautiful Documentation Engine

There was a cool question in the chat:  
**"What are some modern tools for docs besides Docusaurus?"**  
Someone recommended [AstroDocs](https://docs.astro.build/), and damn—it’s elegant.

- **Markdown-first** with components
- SEO-optimized and fast
- Supports custom themes and easily extensible

I’ll try spinning up a docs page using Astro this weekend.

## 🧠 Bonus Find: Browsers for Agents

Unrelated but relevant: I saw this great post on **Daily Dose of Data Science**  
🧵 *How to connect browsers for agent workflows*  
Link: [https://www.datadose.ai/browser-agents](https://www.datadose.ai/browser-agents) ← Worth a read.

- They demo agent browsing using a wrapper with `Playwright`
- Covers user-agent spoofing, sandboxed browsing, and auth-handling
- Super useful for building retrieval-augmented or agentic search systems

Overall: quick hour, solid leads, and I left with ideas to explore over the weekend.  
**Goal:** Try setting up AstroDocs + publish my own demo agent with browser integration this week. Let's go! 🚀
