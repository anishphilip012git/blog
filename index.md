# 🧠 Anish's AI Journey Blog

Welcome to my digital playground where I learn in public, experiment boldly, and track my daily progress in AI, ML, and all things code.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with 7+ years across multiple stacks & clouds. Now, I'm diving deeper into:

- 🤖 AI Engineering & LLMs  
- 🧱 Infrastructure-as-Code & Cloud DevOps  
- 🔐 Security in AI systems  
- 📚 NLP, RAG, and Prompt Engineering  
- 🌐 Open Source + Knowledge Sharing

## ✍️ What This Blog Is

A personal log of what I'm learning, building, and experimenting with — shipped daily or weekly. Think of it as my tech diary in public.

### Topics I’ll be exploring:
- Building agents using LangChain, LlamaIndex
- Training and fine-tuning LLMs
- Building evaluation frameworks (semantic similarity, AI-as-judge)
- Deploying AI systems with Docker, K8s, and CI/CD
- Exploring agent toolchains (CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.)

## 🌱 Why I'm Doing This

- To stay consistent and accountable  
- To turn learning into practice  
- To connect with fellow builders in AI  
- To document my progress & patterns over time

## 📅 Posting Schedule

🗓 **Open Source Fridays** → Contributions & learnings  
🧠 **Weekday Logs** → Short writeups on what I explored  
📈 **Monthly Recap** → Wins, gaps, and what’s next

## 🛠 Built With

- GitHub Pages + Jekyll (or your static site stack of choice)
- Markdown, terminal, and coffee ☕  
- A bit of stubborn curiosity
