## The Bitterness of the Faithful

It’s hard not to sympathize with the elder son in the parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11–32).

- He stayed.
- He worked.
- He obeyed.

But when his reckless younger brother returns, what does the father do?

> He throws a **banquet**.

To the elder son, it feels like betrayal disguised as blessing.  
_"You never even gave me a young goat to celebrate with my friends,"_ he protests.

Sound familiar?

## When Blessing Looks Like Betrayal

Sometimes, we feel like the elder son in our relationship with God:

- We've been faithful for years.
- We've served, given, prayed, obeyed.
- But the celebration? It goes to someone else.

Maybe it’s a new Christian getting breakthrough blessings.  
Maybe it's someone who wandered far from God and returns to open doors.  
It stings.

It feels like _they_ got the **banquet**, while we’re still out in the field.

## The Father's Response

The father's reply is everything:

> _"Son, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours."_

In other words:

- You were never without my presence.
- You already had access to my resources.
- You’ve been living inside the inheritance all along.

The younger son didn’t return richer, holier, or stronger.  
He returned **broken**.

And what did he get?

- One robe.
- One ring.
- One night of welcome.

**All he got was a banquet.**

## Grace Isn't Fair — It’s Better

God's grace offends human fairness — and that’s the point.

> Grace is not a paycheck.  
> It’s a homecoming.

The elder son thought he was being overlooked.  
But the father hadn’t withheld anything.

The banquet wasn’t about rewarding the younger son —  
It was about restoring him.

## The Real Blessing

The banquet wasn't the blessing. Here's what was:

- **Constant access** to the Father.
- **Ongoing trust** and relationship.
- **Full inheritance** and identity.

If you’ve walked faithfully with God and feel unseen when others are celebrated, hear this:

> You haven’t missed the blessing.  
> **You are living in it.**

## Final Thought

When someone comes home, and grace feels too generous —  
don’t let that make your heart bitter.

The Father's love isn’t divided when others return.  
It’s multiplied.

The prodigal got one night of grace.  
You’ve had a lifetime of it.

**All he got was a banquet.  
You have everything.**
