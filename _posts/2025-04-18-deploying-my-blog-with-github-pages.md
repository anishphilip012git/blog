title: "Deploying My Blog with GitHub Pages"

Today I set up my personal blog using **GitHub Pages** and it was surprisingly smooth!

### âœ… What I Did:
- Created a `my-pages` branch on my GitHub repo
- Enabled GitHub Pages from repository settings â†’ selected the correct branch
- Used the default Jekyll theme to keep things clean
- Customized the `README.md` to explain what this blog is about (learning AI/ML and exploring LLMs!)
- Committed my first `_posts/` file to test the blog pipeline

### ðŸ”§ Why GitHub Pages?
- Free hosting
- Clean support for Markdown
- Built-in Jekyll support means I can just write and ship

Excited to use this space as my **learning log**, especially as I go deeper into AI Engineering.
