### 1. Lightning-fast lookups in big data

**Use hashing** (hash maps/tables) for **O(1)** access.

### 2. ‚ÄúHave I seen this before?‚Äù for millions of entries

**Bloom filters** provide tiny-memory, blazing-speed checks‚Äîallowing rare false positives but no false negatives.&#x20;

---

### 3. Speed up slow searches

**Sort & index** your data to improve performance from O(n) to O(log n).

### 4. High-volume log/event writes

Make storage **append-only** for faster, safer high-throughput.

---

### 5. Fast queries on massive databases

Use **B‚Äëtrees** or **LSM trees** to maintain quick disk-based lookups.

### 6. Frequently used data

Implement **caching** to move hot data into memory.

---

### 7. Uptime & no data loss

**Replicate** data across machines for high availability.

### 8. Full-text search on billions of records

Use **inverted indexes** for lightning-fast search.

---

### 9. Analytical queries across many rows

Store data in a **columnar format** for big speedups.

### 10. Scalable time-ordered data (IoT, monitoring, finance)

Employ a **time-series database** optimized for compression and query speed.

---

### 11. Cut storage costs at the expense of CPU

**Compress data**‚Äîjust ensure you're ready for decompression overhead.

### 12. Smooth distributed scaling

Use **consistent hashing** so adding/removing nodes doesn't shuffle all your data.

---

### 13. Crash recovery & auditability

Adopt **write-ahead logging**; changes are logged before applying.

### 14. Efficient range or prefix queries

Try **tries** or **segment trees** for fast data structure operations.

---

### 15. Multi-CPU performance, no locks

Use **lock-free** or **concurrent data structures** (e.g. skip lists, lockless queues).

### 16. Geospatial or multidimensional data

Use **spatial indexes** like R-trees for quick geographical searches.

---

### 17. Fast string matching in huge texts

**Suffix arrays** are powerful yet lighter alternatives to suffix trees.

### 18. Rolling stats or numeric analytics

**Fenwick trees** or **segment trees** make prefix/range queries easy.

---

### 19. Priority queues (job scheduling, Dijkstra‚Äôs, etc.)

Use a **heap** to always get the min/max item quickly.

### 20. Collaborative, distributed apps

Implement **CRDTs** for conflict-free, eventually consistent systems.

---

**Bonus gems:**

* **LSM trees or B-trees** when writing is heavy but queries must stay fast.
* **Bloom filters** for ultra-efficient membership checks‚Äîmemory-light, fast lookup ([linkedin.com][1], [interviewcake.com][2], [redis.io][3]).
* **Columnar vs. row-oriented storage** matters hugely for analytics workloads.
* **Time-series DBs**, compression, consistent hashing, WAL, tries‚Äîeach unlocks scalability, performance, or reliability in their own domain.

---

## üöÄ How to Apply This Every Day

* **Understand the problem domain.** Choose data structures and architectures aligned with your bottlenecks.
* **Measure performance.** Keep an eye on latency, throughput, and resource usage to guide your choices.
* **Stay curious.** These are powerful tools‚Äîlearn how and when to apply them, and stay up-to-date with new techniques.

### üí° TL;DR

* Data structures = foundational tools (hashing, Bloom filters, trees, etc.)
* System designs = built around your data patterns (time-series, spatial, logs, etc.)
* Distributed systems require strategies like consistent hashing, replication, CRDTs

With these ‚Äúcheat codes,‚Äù junior engineers can quickly level up their understanding and build smarter, faster, more scalable systems.
