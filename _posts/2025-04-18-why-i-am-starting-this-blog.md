title: "Why Iâ€™m Starting This Blog"

This blog is my attempt at **learning in public**.

As someone pivoting deeper into **AI Engineering**, I wanted a simple and transparent way to:
- Track what Iâ€™m learning (daily or weekly)
- Stay consistent and build momentum
- Share things I figure out (especially related to NLP, RAG, LLMs, and system design)
- Get feedback from the open source community

Iâ€™ll be writing about:
- Prompt engineering and agent frameworks
- Deploying LLM-based systems
- Infrastructure challenges and cloud optimization
- Any open-source contributions I make along the way

This is my playground, my logbook, and my accountability partner.

If youâ€™re reading this, youâ€™re already part of my journey. ðŸš€
