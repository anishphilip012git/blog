Today I dropped into the [GitHub Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/) event — super chill vibe, lots of curious minds, and great convos. Here's what stood out from my short but insightful session:

## 🚀 MCP Server Setup in VS Code

During today’s Open Source Friday, I came across a super insightful walkthrough on **setting up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** and integrating it with **VS Code**.

🎥 Video reference: [MCP + VS Code Setup – GitHub Open Source Friday](https://www.youtube.com/live/4sKBgos3t1Y?t=4968s)

### 🧰 Key Things I Learned:
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** enables structured interaction and orchestration between various tools, models, and environments
- Works cleanly with **VS Code tasks and launch configurations** for debugging and rapid iteration
- Can be used to manage workflows across multiple AI components or environments

### 💡 Why it matters:
This setup is powerful for:
- Structuring modular AI workflows
- Integrating LLMs into dev environments with fine-grained control
- Building agentic systems that need consistent shared context

I’m planning to test this for a future project where different components (retrievers, agents, toolchains) are orchestrated via MCP.

## 📘 AstroDocs – Beautiful Documentation Engine

One of the discussions in OSF today surfaced a great question:
**"What are some modern tools for documentation besides Docusaurus?"**

Someone suggested [AstroDocs](https://docs.astro.build/) — and I was genuinely impressed.

- Markdown-first with pluggable components
- Built-in SEO optimization, performance tuned
- Simple to start, powerful when extended

I plan to set up a custom docs space using Astro to document my LLM experiments and infrastructure notes. Hoping to pair this with a blog-style changelog for weekly learnings.

## 🌐 Bonus Find: Browserbase for Agent Browsing

Unrelated to OSF but worth noting — I explored **Browserbase**, a programmable, headless browser environment.

🎥 [Browserbase Explained](https://docs.browserbase.com/introduction/what-is-browserbase)

- Lets you control browsers securely via API
- Enables autonomous agents to browse, click, read, and act
- Useful for search agents, research bots, or retrieval pipelines

Planning to integrate this with an LLM agent that can:
> Browse search results, summarize content, and log insights autonomously.

Very excited to prototype this with MCP + Browserbase.
